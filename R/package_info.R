#' episoder: A package for episode and event interval analysis
#'
#' A common approach to analyzing high-resolution behavioural event data, eg. lickometer or
#' feeder recordings, is by grouping individual events into episodes according to inter-event-interval
#' distributions. The episoder package provides several functions for obtaining inter-event-interval and
#' episode information form large, event time-series datasets.
#'
#' The episoder funtions \code{\link{event_intervals}}, \code{\link{add_bins}}, \code{\link{episodes_lable}}
#' annotate data frames containing event data,  while \code{\link{episode_summarize}} generates a summary of episode
#' information according specified in specifed episode parameters.
